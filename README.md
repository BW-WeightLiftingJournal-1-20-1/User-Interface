Task 1: Set up the git project

Create a forked copy of this project.
 - Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
 - Clone your OWN version of the repository.
 - Create a new branch: git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>.
 - Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName> branch, committing changes regularly.
 - Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName>.

Follow these steps for completing your project.

 - Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into master. 
 - Don't merge your own pull request
 - Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
 - Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

 task 2: Set up less preprocessor

- Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running lessc -v in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your team lead for help.
 - Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the cd command
 - Once in your project's root folder, run the following command less-watch-compiler less css index.less
 - Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the background-color on the html selector to red in your index.less file.
 - Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task
